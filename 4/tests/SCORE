Grader:  copy this file into the student's directory and grade
according to the following point values.  There are a max of 30
points for the program and 30 points for the test run.  

The numbers in parens are the max points for a particular section.
Enter some number between 0 and the max depending on the quality
of the work.

________________________________________________________________________
PROGRAM SOURCE CODE. (30)

total source code: /30
min 1, max 30.

   (3) checksource hzip.st >checksource.log
       Deduct nr.complaints / 5, but not worse then (-3)

   (3) Submitted hzip.st with the x bit turned on

   (3) Code to handle options word

   (3) Class BitStream or extends FileStream to handle I/O
       one bit at a time.

   (3) Code to build the Huffman tree

   (3) Code to output the tree into a file

   (3) Code to read the tree from a file

   (3) Code to compress a file and write it

   (3) Code to uncompress a file and write it

   (3) Error messages printed to stderr when something fails.

________________________________________________________________________
TEST RUN.  (30)

Run mk.tests and check the output.

   (4) is the frequency table correct for test5.frequencies

For each of the following, check to see if the compression
and decompression restored the original file.  Use diff where
possible.  Note that the zero, uniform, and gif compressed are
probably large than the original.

   (4) test0.zero.in

   (4) test1.uniform.in

   (4) test3.gif.in

   (4) test4.aaaaaaaa.in

   (4) test5.ps.in

   (4) test6.huffman.in

   (4) test7.etaoin.in

The perfect total for all of the above is 32, but do not
record more than 30 if everything is perfect.  Everyone gets
2 free errors without loss of score.

total testing: /30
min 0, max 30

________________________________________________________________________

Add program + testing totals, giving:
SUBTOTAL=

If pair programming, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL - TOTAL1.
If not, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL.
