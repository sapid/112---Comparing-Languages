This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Benjamin Ross (bpross@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Will Crawford (wacrawfo@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual.s effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.
Ben spent 3  hours working alone.
Will spent 2 hours working alone.
We spent 30 hours working together.
Ben spent 15 hours driving.
Will spent 15 hours driving.
